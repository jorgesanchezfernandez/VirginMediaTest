# Please read carefully before initialize the React App

This is an application that involves a frontend client side, implemented by ReactJS and a backend REST WebAPI, implemented by .Net Core Web API.

For space reasons, I have deleted the node_modules, located inside the VirginTestClient project.

Without this folder and the inside packages installed, the application will generate errors and it won't be successfully executed.

If you are familiar with node, please install the modules within the  VirginTest folder with: npm install

If you are not, please follow the next steps:

1 - Make sure that you have installed node.js https://nodejs.org/en/
2 - Open a command console
3 - Navigate to inside the client side folder named "VirginTest"
4 - Execute: npm install

That should be all to generate the required modules locally.

This app is has been implemented in Visual Studio 2022. If you don't have installed this version please follow the instruction to be opened
in another version as the solution migration into a older Visual Studio version won't be successfully loaded.

Visual studio 2022:
	- Please, make sure that you have the node_modules installed, as mentioned above.
	- Open the solution in Visual Studio 2022. 
	- Then, you can run the application normally in visual studio.

Visual studio 2019 or older:
	- Please, make sure that you have the node_modules installed, as mentioned above. 
	- Create a new blank solution and add the existing VirginTestWebApi in it.
	- Open the VirginTest folder in Visual Studio Code.
	- Run the VirginTestWebApi normally in Visual Studio.
	- Open a console in Visual Studio Code and run 'npm start'.
	That should be all to visualize the test correctly.

Please, contact me if there are any issues or if the instruction are not completely clear.


I hope you enjoy this test. Best regards!
